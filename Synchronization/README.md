# Problem Statement

Given a 2D matrix of floaing point numbers perform the following operations in sequence.

1. Swap elements at even and odd positions of the lower triangular matrix (including the principal diagonal)
2. Reflect the values of the matrix across the principal diagonal i.e. A[j][i]=A[i][j] where i is not equal to j.

Your code should have provisions to randomly generate a matrix of any size and perform the above two operations.
